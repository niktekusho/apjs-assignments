The user should see the following:
1.  An application description labeled "Select two Starships from the dropdown lists to compare"
2.  Two drop down lists full of starships
3.  A button labeled "Compare"
4.  A table that shows the attributes of the two starships being compared (name, cost, speed, cargo size, passengers)

The user should be able to do the following:
1.  Populate the comparison table by selecting two starships from the drop down lists and pressing the "Compare" button. In each table row, the attribute with the higher value should have its cell highlighted red.
